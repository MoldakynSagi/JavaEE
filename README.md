A project for choosing a wine, when you click on a brand of wine, it displays information about the wine. And we used different classes for example as:
LiquorType class for storing the liquor types of our application. Then I created a service class (LiquorService.java) to hold the business logic of the application. This is a simple java class that defines the necessary methods. For example, this class has a getAvailableBrands () method that returns a list of brands for a given type of alcohol. We then create a SelectLiquorSevlet.java class that handles the custom request from the HTML page. SelectLiquorServlet will accept the POST request from the form submission and call the doPost () method
And at the end we will create a JSP page to display the result
